# James Middleton's CV

This repository contains my CV written in LaTeX, based on [this template on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/rendercv-engineeringresumes-theme/shwqvsxdgkjy).

Feel free to use this as a template for you to create your own CV.

## Getting Started

Use VSCode with the [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) plugin.

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed for this to work:

```sh
brew install texlive tex-fmt
```

The VSCode workspace settings should ensure that source TeX files are formatted using `tex-fmt` on save.

While editing, the LaTeX Workshop extension will compile a PDF using `texlive` for you to review visually.
